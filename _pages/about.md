I'm a Staff Software Engineer at LinkedIn, and I build the ABC's of [LinkedIn Jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/talent/post-a-job).
* **A**buse prevention: protect jobs marketplace with abuse detection and quality prediction.
* **B**udget delivery: optimize jobs auction and delivery with auto bidding and budget pacing.
* **C**andidate targeting: recommend qualified candidates based on jobs targeting criteria.

Previously, I was with Samsung MNO Lab where I focused on advanced R&amp;D &mdash; prototyping solutions for Internet of Things, smart home, and connected car using machine learning and mobile computing technology. These innovations have turned into a number of patents and are on the way to being commercialized.

Before joining industry, I received the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Michigan State University. My graduate research revolved around mobile computing and cyber-physical systems. Results of my work were published in top-tier conferences and journals, such as ACM&nbsp;MobiSys, ACM/IEEE&nbsp;IPSN, and IEEE&nbsp;TMC.
